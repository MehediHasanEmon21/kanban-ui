## Getting Started

It's super easy to get Kanban ui up and running.

First clone the project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MehediHasanEmon21/kanban-ui.git
```
Go to the kanban-ui repository, then put the folder in web server.

Note: Before running kanban ui, kanban api should be running first.
